3. The folder consists of the following files :-
   -->home.py : it consists of the empty futoshiki board with pre-defined constraints along with the proposed solution taken as input by the user.
   It further invokes functions from functions.py file to valdate this solution.
   -->testing.py : it consists of the empty futoshiki board along with 4 proposed solutions for testing purpose.
   It further invokes functions from functions.py file to valdate these solutions.
   -->functions.py : it consists of all the function definitions required for the processing of the validation of the proposed solutions, given in home.py and testing.py.

4. For execution :-
--> To execute home.py : type <python home.py> in the terminal. 
   It will take inputs from user in order to create the proposed solution,and will then display the appropriate result after validation.
--> To execute testing.py : type <python testing.py> in the terminal. 
   It will display the appropriate result after validation of the 4 proposed test solutions.
